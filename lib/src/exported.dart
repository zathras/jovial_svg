/// In Flutter version 3.10.4 (June 2023), an inconfirmed report of a
/// new Flutter bug related to `dispose()` and image handling was
/// reported -- see https://github.com/zathras/jovial_svg/issues/62.
/// `silentlyIgnoreErrors`  was added at this time.
///
/// As of Flutter 2.5, other usese of this enum became obsolete.
/// It is maintained for backwards compatibility with earlier versions.
///
/// As of the initial date of publication of this library, there were several
/// bugs in the then-current shipped version of Flutter (2.2.2)
/// involving the `dispose()`
/// method of `ImageDescriptor` and `ImmutableImageBuffer`.  The only safe
/// thing to do with this version of Flutter was to refrain from calling
/// `dispose()` on these objects.  This is non-optimal, since it is a potential
/// memory leak.  Even if a future version of Flutter correctly uses
/// finalization to eventually dispose of the native memory backing these
/// objects, large amounts of native memory might be retained for a significant
/// amount of time, until the Dart objects are eventually reclaimed and
/// finalized.
///
/// For this reason, a setting to call `dispose()` on one or both of these
/// objects was exposed.  That way, an application can cause `dispose()` to be
/// called when the Flutter libraries are fixed, even if `jovial_svg` is not
/// updated to follow the Flutter releases.  In addition, `jovial_svg` should
/// be conservative about following the latest Flutter releases too closely,
/// as regards the default behavior.
///
/// Further, it was not documented if client code was supposed to call
/// `ImmutableImageBuffer.dispose()` after handing the buffer off to
/// `ImageDescriptor`.  The most reasonable answer is "yes" - typically, one
/// uses reference counting internally for this sort of thing - but given
/// the instability of this area of Flutter, counting on the eventual
/// specification going either way would have been risky.  For this reason,
/// we separate out the two `dispose()` calls in the global setting.
///
/// See also [ScalableImage.imageDisposeBugWorkaround], where clients of this
/// library can change the behavior.
///
/// Relevant bugs on Flutter include:
///   * https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/83421
///   * https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/83764
///   * https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/83908
///   * https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/83910
///
/// Note that these may have been fixed by
/// https://github.com/flutter/engine/pull/26435, but as of the date of this
/// library's initial publication, that had not yet been released.  As of
/// Flutter 2.5, it has been.

/// The main entry point to this library.  This class features several
/// static methods to load a [ScalableImage] from various sources.  It
/// provides two in-memory representations:  a memory-saving "compact"
/// representation, as well as a faster internal graph structure.  Provision
/// is given to set a viewport, and prune away nodes that are outside
/// this viewport.  In this way, several smaller "views" onto a larger
/// SI asset can be produced, with maximal resource sharing between the
/// different assets.
///
/// A [ScalableImage] can be used directly, e.g. using a Flutter
/// `CustomPaint` widget, or it can be displayed using a
/// `ScalableImageWidget`.
///
/// Note that rendering a scalable image can be time-consuming if the
/// underlying scene is complex.  Notably, GPU performance can be a
/// bottleneck.  If one or more [ScalableImage] instances is used in animation,
/// or has animation played over it, it might be worthwhile to cache
/// a pre-rendered version of the [ScalableImage].  cf. Flutter's
/// `Picture.toImage` and the notes about `RepaintBoundary` in
/// `ScalableImageWidget`.
///
/// Note that, while [ScalableImage] is declared as `@immutable`, and obeys
/// the `@immutable` contract, instances
/// can contain images which can be loaded and unloaded (see
/// [prepareImages] and [unprepareImages]).  Used correctly, [ScalableImage]
/// instances are what you might call semantically immutable.  Indeed, aside
/// from loading and unloading embedded assets, their internal state is
/// read-only.  However, they are not strictly immutable in
/// the traditional computer science sense of the word, which requires all
/// reachable objects being unmodifiable.  A buggy application could
/// corrupt the internal state by calling [unprepareImages] excessively, for
/// example, which could cause embedded images to not render.
