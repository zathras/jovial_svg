/// This library offers a `ScalableImage` that can be loaded from:
///
///   *  An SVG file.
///   *  An Android Vector Drawable file
///   *  A more compact and much more efficient `.si` file that was
///      compiled from an SVG or AVD file.
///
///  A robust profile of SVG targeted at static images is supported.  It
///  generally consists of the features that are relevant to static images
///  defined in
///  [SVG Tiny 1.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-SVGTiny12-20081222/),
///  plus many commonly-used elements from
///  [SVG 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/REC-SVG11-20110816/).  More details
///  about the supported SVG profile can be found in the top-level
///  documentation, or in the
///  [github repo](https://github.com/zathras/jovial_svg)'s README.
///
///  A compact `.si` file can be created with `dart run jovial_svg:svg_to_si`
///  or `dart run jovial_svg:avd_to_si` (after  running `dart pub get`).
///
// ignore: comment_references
///  [ScalableImageWidget] can be used to display a [ScalableImage].
///  The image can be automatically scaled by the widget, and fit into the
///  available area with a `BoxFit` and an `Alignment`.
// ignore: comment_references
///  [ScalableImageWidget]
// ignore: comment_references
///  will, if needed, asynchronously load a [ScalableImage] asset and
///  prepare any embedded pixel-based images.
