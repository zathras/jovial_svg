description: SVG - Robust rendering of Scalable Vector Graphic images, supporting a well-defined profile of SVG and a fast-loading binary storage format.
version: 1.1.17-rc.1
homepage:  https://bill.jovial.com/

environment:
  sdk: ">=2.19.0 <4.0.0"
  flutter: ">=3.0.0"
    #  SDK 2.19 required for IndexError.withLength.
    #  
    #  Flutter 3.0 and SDK 2.17 marked as required on May 12, 2022 to work
    #  around breakage on pub.dev.  
    #  cf. https://pub.dev/packages/jovial_svg/versions/1.1.5-rc.1/score
    #  Before that...
    #  
    #  Flutter 2.5.0 or better is needed, because previous versions had a bug
    #  related to image disposal.  For versions prior to 2.5.0, one would need
    #  to change the value of ScalableImage.imageDisposeBugWorkaround back
    #  to disposeNeither, as was the case in jovial_svg 1.0.6 and prior.
    #
    #  Flutter 2.5 was introduced with SDK version 2.14.  Note that 
    #  2.14 is also required for the migration away from Google's
    #  "pedantic," since unawaited was moved to async.
