## [1.0.6] - June 27, 2021

  a trivial dartfmt run, and I suppose this might influence the search
  algorithm.

  [Jarle](https://github.com/jarlestabell)).

- Eliminated dependencies on `dart:io`, so that library will work on JS.
  - This did involve an API change, but the old version was on pub.dev
    for maybe an hour, so I'm not considering this a breaking change.

## [1.0.0] - Initial Release, June 15, 2021

Initial release, after testing on a reasonable sample of SVG images
believed to be representative.
